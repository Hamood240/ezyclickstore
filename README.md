Install XAMPP:
Download XAMPP from the official website.
Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Run the installer and follow the instructions to install XAMPP.
Start XAMPP Services:
After installation, open XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking the “Start” button next to each.
These services are essential for running PHP scripts and managing databases.
Create a PHP Project:
Navigate to the XAMPP installation directory (usually C:\xampp on Windows).
Inside the htdocs folder, create a new directory for your PHP project (e.g., my-php-project).
Write a Simple PHP File:
Open a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Create a new PHP file (e.g., index.php) inside your project folder.
Write some PHP code (e.g., <?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?>).
Access Your PHP Project:
Open a web browser.
Type http://localhost/my-php-project/index.php in the address bar.
You should see the output of your PHP script (in this case, “Hello, World!”).
Managing Databases (Optional):
XAMPP includes phpMyAdmin for managing MySQL databases.
Access phpMyAdmin by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create databases, tables, and manage data using the web interface.
